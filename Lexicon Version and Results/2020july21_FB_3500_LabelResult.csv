social security should not be privatized but we should do the right thing for the beneficiaries currently the social security trust fund has 2 8 billion of assets all invested at treasury bond yields the returns on these assets effect the overall solvency of social security the lower the returns the more pressure on the program if this were a pension fund the managers of the fund would invest these assets in the market to ensure higher long term returns but we don t do that we invest them at treasury bond rates the data is overwhelmingly clear if you invest in the market you earn much higher rates across the long term then if you invest in treasury bonds in many ways the largest asset each average american owns is their right to social security which they create by paying into with their wages it s a great program but doesn t it seem unfair that we don t invest these contributions for a higher rate of return thing about it this way rich people invest their savings in retirement accounts in the stock market most americans who don t have excess savings only have social security which is invested in treasuries the stock market goes up faster than returns on treasuries making matters worse when after the recession we cut interest rates this made the stock market go up and the rate on the social security trust fund go down just to be clear i m not for privatizing social security your social security benefits should not go down because the stock marekt went down but across time if we would have invested the social security trust fund assets better we could now be in a position of increasing social security benefits it s another example of the average american getting a bad deal,"economic,social programs","beneficiaries,savings,stock,recession,security trust,wages,social security","economic,social programs"

i think bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are entirely correct to advocate for universal healthcare although i don t agree with their specific plans and the other candidates advocating for a public option are not being ambitious enough on healthcare we need universal healthcare our healthcare system is largely broken costs are very high quality is uneven and many don t have coverage or they have inadequate coverage the right goal is to have universal coverage by universal coverage i mean that every citizen is provided federal healthcare coverage for free most developed nations have a system that does this i have a plan to do that as does bernie sanders and elizabeth warren to my mind healthcare is a human right and we can only control costs improve quality if we get everyone covered others who are running are proposing a public option a public option is a government run insurance company it will have premiums co pays deductibles etc a public option is fine in the same way that any incremental improvement is fine but it doesn t solve the problem where i differ with bernie sanders and elizabeth warren is on the form of universal healthcare they are proposing a single payer system which very few countries have my universal healthcare plan is a mixed model like most developed countries have including germany and france everyone gets covered for free but they can opt out have other insurance options the reason i like a mixed model is because i believe it is better policy a mixed model is easier to finance since you don t have to change the whole system it gives people choices which they like and it has shown to produce higher quality healthcare bottom line i m closer to bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on healthcare than i am to the others,"social programs,health","universal healthcare,universal coverage,healthcare,payer system,single payer,premiums,public option,healthcare plan,single payer system,insurance company,deductibles","health,social programs"

i think bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are entirely correct to advocate for universal healthcare although i don t agree with their specific plans and the other candidates advocating for a public option are not being ambitious enough on healthcare we need universal healthcare our healthcare system is largely broken costs are very high quality is uneven and many don t have coverage or they have inadequate coverage the right goal is to have universal coverage by universal coverage i mean that every citizen is provided federal healthcare coverage for free most developed nations have a system that does this i have a plan to do that as does bernie sanders and elizabeth warren to my mind healthcare is a human right and we can only control costs improve quality if we get everyone covered others who are running are proposing a public option a public option is a government run insurance company it will have premiums co pays deductibles etc a public option is fine in the same way that any incremental improvement is fine but it doesn t solve the problem where i differ with bernie sanders and elizabeth warren is on the form of universal healthcare they are proposing a single payer system which very few countries have my universal healthcare plan is a mixed model like most developed countries have including germany and france everyone gets covered for free but they can opt out have other insurance options the reason i like a mixed model is because i believe it is better policy a mixed model is easier to finance since you don t have to change the whole system it gives people choices which they like and it has shown to produce higher quality healthcare bottom line i m closer to bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on healthcare than i am to the others,"social programs,health","universal healthcare,universal coverage,healthcare,payer system,single payer,premiums,public option,healthcare plan,single payer system,insurance company,deductibles","health,social programs"
