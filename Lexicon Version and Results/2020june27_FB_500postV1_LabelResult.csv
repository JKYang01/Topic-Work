i think bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are entirely correct to advocate for universal healthcare although i don t agree with their specific plans and the other candidates advocating for a public option are not being ambitious enough on healthcare we need universal healthcare our healthcare system is largely broken costs are very high quality is uneven and many don t have coverage or they have inadequate coverage the right goal is to have universal coverage by universal coverage i mean that every citizen is provided federal healthcare coverage for free most developed nations have a system that does this i have a plan to do that as does bernie sanders and elizabeth warren to my mind healthcare is a human right and we can only control costs improve quality if we get everyone covered others who are running are proposing a public option a public option is a government run insurance company it will have premiums co pays deductibles etc a public option is fine in the same way that any incremental improvement is fine but it doesn t solve the problem where i differ with bernie sanders and elizabeth warren is on the form of universal healthcare they are proposing a single payer system which very few countries have my universal healthcare plan is a mixed model like most developed countries have including germany and france everyone gets covered for free but they can opt out have other insurance options the reason i like a mixed model is because i believe it is better policy a mixed model is easier to finance since you don t have to change the whole system it gives people choices which they like and it has shown to produce higher quality healthcare bottom line i m closer to bernie sanders and elizabeth warren on healthcare than i am to the others,"social programs,health","healthcare,germany,costs,insurance company,healthcare plan,single payer,payer system,france,deductibles,premiums,universal coverage","economic,foreign policy,health,social programs"
