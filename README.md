# Topic-Work
The scripts of  topic work, including the train and testing dataset, scripts of lexicon developing and tagging. 

## The tagging script 
This script is for tagging the data set with the developed lexiocn and the pre-trained language model.
We applied a pre-trained language model — spaCy2.2 English Language Model — to do the n-gram tokenization and matching. 

## Finding more language cues with Word2Vec embedding and Support Vector Models (SVM)
A file contains the processing scripts including:
1. SVM classification
2. one-hot encoding
3. Find Topic with Word2Vec (Generate TSV files and illustrated the word embedding on http://projector.tensorflow.org/)
4. develop covid lexicon 

## Optimize the lexicon 
1. find the missclassifing seed words
2. calculate the ratio of correct 
3. Make new lexicon (Version1-Version4.7)
