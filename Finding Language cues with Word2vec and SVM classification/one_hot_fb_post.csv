Fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault â a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.

For the people meant fighting for a fairer criminal justice system. At a time when prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys, we created an initiative to get skills and job training instead of jail time for young people arrested for drugs.

For the people meant fighting for middle-class families who had been defrauded by banks and were losing their homes by the millions in the Great Recession. We went after the five biggest banks in the United States and won $20 billion for California homeowners and together we passed the strongest anti-foreclosure law in the United States of America.

The ACLU conducted a thorough study of over 8 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, and found that 88 percent of those were for marijuana possession. Alarmingly, the study also found that African Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white peers, even though they use marijuana at similar rates. 

Last year, I introduced the Marijuana Justice Act that would deschedule marijuana at the federal level and allow states to legalize the drug. And very importantly, the bill includes expungement provisions, community reinvestment provisions, and pushes states to correct for any disparate treatment in their enforcement practices. â 

I hope everyone who is in favor of legalization will speak up about the urgency of expungement and become an advocate and activist for a broader and more restorative justice. We should legalize marijuana and help those who have suffered due to its prohibition.","safety, social cultural","safety, social cultural","safety, social cultural",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

My bills include the bipartisan Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act which would amend federal law to allow states to set their own medical marijuana policies; and most recently, the Marijuana Justice Actâa bill that would end the federal prohibition on of marijuana, allow for the expungement of past marijuana convictions, reinvest in communities disproportionately affected by the drug war, and incentivize states to legalize it at the state level if they disproportionately arrest or incarcerate poor people or people of color. â 

We need to face the number of our neglected, chronically traumatized children. And we need to face our failure to wage peace and stand up for democratic and higher human values around the world. The good news is this: once we do those things, then we will have breakthroughs the likes. of which we cannot now even imagine. â¬We are good and decent people; the problem is that too often our governmentâs behavior is not aligned with that goodness.

With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own backyard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.

First, since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his administration have continually vilified immigrants for political purposes. Their new immigration plan would go even further to sabotage our nationâs principles.

Second, if we want to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it's clear that the Democratic nominee will need to have a real alternative to Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. I have that plan -- and I'm the only Democrat running for President who's articulated one so far.

In April, I put forward my People First Immigration plan to show Americans that thereâs an alternative to Trumpâs cruelty â one that treats those who seek refuge from violence and turmoil with compassion, addresses the root causes of migration, and protects our borders. bit.ly/PeopleFirstImmigration

This is possible when the president is working toward solutions instead of sowing chaos for political gain. 

Some Democrats may not see immigration as a winning issue, but there has been no issue that more clearly demonstrates the cruelty and incompetence of this administration than immigration.

On January 20, 2021 we will have an opportunity to get this right. As President, I will lead us to an immigration system that actually benefits America.

Before we get there, though, I need your support. Our ideas need you to give them life. Please support our campaign: bit.ly/jcforthefuture",immigration,immigration,immigration,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Today, we should all remember that racism isn't a talking point, it is the reason Emmett isn't here with us and why his mother's grief is still so familiar all these decades later.

His behavior is disgraceful and an embarrassment to the American people. Unless Republicans believe that Donald Trump is a fair and accurate representation of the Republican party as a whole, they should put up a challenger to run against him in the primary election. One of the biggest problems facing the country is that very few Republicans have shown the courage to stand up to Trump. We canât go very far as a country if only one political party is committed to decency, honesty, and character.
 
Voices like John Kasich and Governor Hogan, from my state, would do an enormous service to not just their party, but to their fellow Americans to stand up and challenge this President. 
 
I believe that we need a Democrat in the White House and that we will have a Democrat in the White House in 2021. But step one in repairing our democracy is having two political parties committed to truth and decency. 
 
This country needs a serious debate about how we address income and opportunity inequality, technology, climate change, our terrible fiscal trajectory, healthcare, immigration, and emerging threats from the global community. These are all topics that this President is uniquely unqualified and frankly unable to address in any meaningful way. We need to restore a sense of decency and unity to our politics.","economic, environmental, social programs, immigration","economic, environment, social programs, immigration","economic, environment, social programs, immigration",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
