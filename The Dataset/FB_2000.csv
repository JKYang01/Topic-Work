"Every one of the Democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than Donald Trump. But the race for the Democratic nomination is a fractured one. It's not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map, and the process won't be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines. That's never been our focus дуо our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere.

For months, Elizabeth has been near or at the top of the list of candidates that voters are considering for president. According to the latest Economist/YouGov poll, 40-50% of voters across all age groups are considering voting for Warren, including 58% of self-described liberals and 38% of self-described moderates. Elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the Democratic ticket to defeat Donald Trump.

Our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early. But here's what we do know: Elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before.

Elizabeth is progressive, effective, and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight. With a strong organization of more than 1,000 staff on the ground in 31 states, bolstered by a movement of more than 1,000,000 grassroots donors, we are confident that as Americans continue to get to know Elizabeth, they'll see what we see every day: Elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat Donald Trump in November. 

But the only way we'll win this nomination is if everyone reading this digs deep and funds our 100% grassroots-funded campaign. Can you help us keep moving forward? Chip in $2, $20 or whatever you can to power this movement through the critical races to come.",no topic

My Fair Workweek plan builds on the work of these committed advocates and activists, and ensures that every part-time worker in America is treated with respect and can build a future for themselves and the people they love. It will: 
- Require employers with 15 or more employees to give two weeks of advance notice of work schedules
- Empower employees to ask for schedules that work for them without fear of retaliation.
- Ensure a right to rest between shifts.
- Require employers to offer additional work hours to existing, qualified, part-time workers before hiring new employees or contractors.

I learned the values of hard work and pride of community from a young age. My parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica with just a 5th grade education, seeking greater opportunity for our family. My father labored for 16 years in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and my mom would cook to feed the migrant workers. I was born in rural Pahokee, Florida and grew up in South Bay.

Thanks to the opportunity this country provided for my family, the support of my parents and mentors, and lots of time and effort in class and on the field, I earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where I started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship team.

After my NFL dreams were cut short, my wife Angela and I built one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country and our projects in the educational and non-profit space have garnered national recognition, including from the U.S. Green Building Council for building one of the greenest schools in the Southeast United States.

I then went into public service, first as a city commissioner, then rising to serve as a two-term mayor of Miramarдуоone of Floridaду»s most diverse cities.

Today, Miramar ranks as one of the fastest-growing city economies in the country. We actively foster innovation and development, from starting an aviation expo and tech camps to expose young people to the tools that can solve the problems of today and tomorrow.

I am proud of our record in Miramar as weду»ve:

Fought to bring American jobs back from China.
Passed a living wage for city workers.
Recruited companies with high-paying jobs to hire Floridians.
Led the fight against the oil industryду»s campaign to drill in Big Cypress National Preserve, adjacent to the Everglades and just a few miles from our city.
Joined mayors across the country to oppose climate denialism and pledge to support the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Taken on the Trump administration to protect immigrants, proposing our city as a safe zone for those who come to this country seeking a better life.
Sued the state of Florida to protect our residents from gun violence and overturn a law backed by the NRA.
Proposed and passed relief on water bills for federal workers who were impacted by the shutdown.
My college sweetheart, business partner, and better half Angela and I have been married for more than 20 years as weду»ve built our lives in Miramar and raised our kids. Our three children, Wayne II and twin daughters Kayla and Kyla, attend college in South Florida.

"In 2005, the banking industry, with its deep pockets and Congressional allies, successfully passed a bankruptcy bill that devastated families across the country who needed relief from debt collection.

That 2005 bill made the 2008 financial crisis significantly worse: experts found that the bill думcaused about 800,000 additional mortgage defaults and 250,000 additional foreclosures.дуќ

"I spent most of my career studying one simple question: why do American families go broke? 

I found that no one дуо not even the supposed думexpertsдуќ дуо had actually dug into the data to figure out what drove families into bankruptcy. So I found two incredible partners and set out to gather the data about why families go broke. That was back when you had to collect information by hand, and courts charged a lot to make copies for you. To save money, I flew around to courthouses all over the country with my own photocopier дуо nicknamed R2D2 дуо strapped into the airplane seat next to me, copying thousands of bankruptcy filings to begin understanding why American families turned to bankruptcy. 

Iду»ll never forget sitting in a wood-paneled courtroom in San Antonio on one of my first trips, watching the families filing for bankruptcy move in and out of the courtroom to appear in front of the judge. They looked just like the family I grew up in дуо hanging on to the ragged edge of the middle class. Now they were standing in front of a judge, ready to give up nearly everything they owned just to get some relief from the bill collectors. 

Our research ended up showing that most of these families werenду»t reckless or irresponsible дуо what many people thought at the time дуо they were just getting squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt and more risk to cling to their place in Americaду»s middle class. And that meant one bad break could send them tumbling over the edge. 

My plan aims to undo the harm of the 2005 banking industry-backed bill that made it harder for families to get the relief they need and overhaul consumer bankruptcy rules. As president, I will:
- Make it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy.
- Expand peopleду»s rights to take care of themselves and their children while they are in the bankruptcy process.
- End the absurd rules that make it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy.
- Let more people protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a firm foundation when they start to pick up the pieces and rebuild their financial lives.
- Help address shameful racial and gender disparities that plague our bankruptcy system.
- Close loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else.

"Higher education opened a million doors for me. Itду»s how the daughter of a janitor got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. Senator, and eventually, a candidate for President of the United States.

Today, itду»s virtually impossible for a young person to find that kind of opportunity. As states have invested less per-student at community colleges and public four-year colleges, the schools themselves have raised tuition and fees to make up the gap. And rather than stepping in to hold states accountable, or to pick up more of the tab and keep costs reasonable, the federal government went with a third option: pushing families that canду»t afford to pay the outrageous costs of higher education towards taking out loans.

Thatду»s why Iду»m calling for something truly transformational дуо the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans.

Once weду»ve cleared out the debt thatду»s holding down an entire generation of Americans, we must ensure that we never have another student debt crisis again. We can do that by recognizing that a public college education is like a public K-12 education дуо a basic public good that should be available to everyone with free tuition and zero debt at graduation.","social programs, education"
"""ду»Anybody in here have student loan debt?ду» Warren asked the crowd. дуЦAnybody in here know someone with student loan debt? Okay, I think we got almost everybody.ду»

думShe then asked people in the audience to take out their phones and plug their student debt amounts into the calculator, which can be found directly on her 2020 presidential campaign website.

думThe calculator poses a short series of questions дуо about what type of schooling an individual took out loans for, how much student debt they accumulated, and how much their total income was the previous year. The calculator then uses that information to determine exactly how much of that individual's student debt would be canceled under Warren's plan.

думAccording to CNN, Warren's plan would eliminate up to $50,000 in student debt for anyone living in a household that earns less than $100,000 per year. People from households that make between $100,000 and $250,000 annually would have student debt canceled on a sliding scale proportional to their income, Business Insider reported, while those from households making $250,000 or more would not qualify for any student debt cancellation.дуќ","social programs, education"

I hope everyone who is in favor of legalization will speak up about the urgency of expungement and become an advocate and activist for a broader and more restorative justice. We should legalize marijuana and help those who have suffered due to its prohibition.","safety, social cultural"

"Federal marijuana policy has long overstepped the boundaries of common sense, fiscal prudence, and compassion. Not to mention the hypocrisy of presidents, senators and Congress members openly admiring they have done a drug that others in this country, less privileged, have been arrested for. ⠀

I've introduced two bills that would get the federal government out of the marijuana business, end the hypocrisy and embrace common sense. My bills include the bipartisan Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act which would amend federal law to allow states to set their own medical marijuana policies; and most recently, the Marijuana Justice Act—a bill that would end the federal prohibition on of marijuana, allow for the expungement of past marijuana convictions, reinvest in communities disproportionately affected by the drug war, and incentivize states to legalize it at the state level if they disproportionately arrest or incarcerate poor people or people of color. ⠀

Pumping in my living room.

Just like hopes springing high,

Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own backyard.

You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,

Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.

"This country—though we would like to think otherwise—was founded on racism, has persisted through racism, and is racist today. And if you don’t want to accept that phrase, or that word, or that distinction, look at this:

There is 10 times the wealth in white America today than there is in black America. There are 2.3 million people behind bars, the largest prison population on the planet bar none, disproportionately comprised of people of color, though we know that people of all races use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate. In a Kindergarten classroom, a four or five-year-old child of color is five times as likely to be disciplined, or suspended, or expelled as a white child in front of the same teacher for the same infraction. We have a maternal mortality crisis in this country that is 3x as deadly for women of color. And disparities in infant mortality between white Americans and black Americans are greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850—15 years before the abolition of slavery.

This racism, though foundational—literally kidnapping people from West Africa, bringing them here to build the greatness of this country on their backs, and then denying their descendants the meaningful opportunity to enjoy in the wealth that they had created—has for so long flown under the surface.

But in this administration, and with this president, that racism was invited out into the open. For the last three years, there has been a rise in hate crimes in every single one of them. Those counties that hosted a Trump rally in 2016 saw, on average, more than a 200% increase in hate crimes. A president who promised to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every walk of life, from every tradition of faith. On the day he signed his Executive Order, attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground.

Let us make sure that at this moment, this defining moment of truth, this moment of peril in which the president has placed us, that in this great democracy, where the government is the people and the people are the government, the responsibility to respond to this is on every single one of us. And to do so, we must connect the dots, as we’ve just connected them, and understand the consequences and the cost of this president. We must absolutely come together, all of us, to change it.

"I have some thoughts about the Trump immigration plan.... 

First, since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his administration have continually vilified immigrants for political purposes. Their new immigration plan would go even further to sabotage our nation’s principles.

Second, if we want to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it's clear that the Democratic nominee will need to have a real alternative to Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. I have that plan -- and I'm the only Democrat running for President who's articulated one so far.

In April, I put forward my People First Immigration plan to show Americans that there’s an alternative to Trump’s cruelty — one that treats those who seek refuge from violence and turmoil with compassion, addresses the root causes of migration, and protects our borders. bit.ly/PeopleFirstImmigration

This is possible when the president is working toward solutions instead of sowing chaos for political gain. 

Some Democrats may not see immigration as a winning issue, but there has been no issue that more clearly demonstrates the cruelty and incompetence of this administration than immigration.

On January 20, 2021 we will have an opportunity to get this right. As President, I will lead us to an immigration system that actually benefits America.

"Brown v. Board was decided 65 years ago but our fight for equality is not over. The work to ensure we have equity and full opportunity in our classrooms, our schools, and our education system must continue. 

The work continues when we see an unconscionable achievement gap in our classrooms that is already in full force on the very first day of kindergarten -- where black children are already 10 months behind in math and 12 months behind in reading compared to their white classmates. The work continues when in that same kindergarten classroom, children of color are five times more likely to be disciplined, suspended, or expelled as a white child -- impacting their opportunity and potential. A school to prison pipeline in full effect at five years old. The work continues when we see shameful race-based disparities in HS graduation rates, in who can access higher education or skills training, and in who earns a degree. Happening as we fail to invest equitable resources in education and fail to make higher education affordable.

But I am committed to meeting this challenge with everything we've got. It starts by increasing public school funding for low-income and underserved communities, guaranteeing the equitable distribution of resources, and ensuring teachers reflect the diversity of this country. 

It continues by finally achieving universal pre-k for every three and four-year-old, securing affordable childcare, signing into law paid family leave, and ensuring our country's minimum wage is a living wage so no parent has to work a second or third job to make ends meet. We will also decriminalize truancy. States like Texas have taken the first step by repealing laws that prosecute children for truancy, but the fines their parents face still loom large in a system that disproportionately targets black and brown students. I will take this on.

And as president, I will only nominate judges who respect, affirm, and defend Brown v. Board. Andrew Oldham doesn't get nominated. Neither does Wendy Vitter. If you don't believe in civil rights, in equity, in opportunity, you don't belong in a position of public trust.","social cultural, social programs, governance, safety, economic, education"

I won’t be polite to big oil when they pollute our water and air. I haven't been polite about Trump's backward agenda, which I've voted against more than anyone in the Senate.

So now you know what I won’t do. Let me tell you what I will do.

I will fight for Clean Elections to get money out of politics. I will fight for Medicare for All. I will fight to strengthen our public schools and increase teacher pay. I will take on the institutional racism that pervades education, health care, and housing. I have a long history of taking on big fights in Congress—even when I stand alone—and getting things done.

"Social Security should not be privatized but we should do the right thing for the beneficiaries. 

Currently the Social Security Trust Fund has $2.8 Billion of assets all invested at treasury bond yields. The returns on these assets effect the overall solvency of social security. The lower the returns, the more pressure on the program. If this were a pension fund, the managers of the fund would invest these assets in the market to ensure higher long term returns. 

But we don't do that. We invest them at Treasury Bond rates. The data is overwhelmingly clear, if you invest in the market you earn much higher rates across the long term then if you invest in Treasury Bonds 

In many ways the largest asset each average American owns is their right to social security, which they create by paying into with their wages. It's a great program but doesn't it seem unfair that we don't invest these contributions for a higher rate of return?

Thing about it this way. Rich people invest their savings in retirement accounts in the stock market. Most Americans, who don't have excess savings, only have social security, which is invested in Treasuries The stock market goes up faster than returns on Treasuries. 

Making matters worse, when after the recession we cut interest rates. This made the stock market go up and the rate on the social security trust fund go down. 

Just to be clear, I'm not for privatizing social security. Your social security benefits should not go down because the stock marekt went down.  But across time, if we would have invested the Social Security Trust fund assets better, we could now be in a position of increasing social security benefits.  It's another example of the average American getting a bad deal.","social programs, economic"

Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam has led the opposition against this project, building a robust coalition of local residents, environmental advocates, county and city governments who are in front of the issue.
 
Statement from Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam “This deeply disappointing ruling threatens the public health, environment and quality of life of thousands of Floridians who proudly call Miramar and the surrounding area home. Drilling in our backyard will put our community’s drinking water at great risk and endanger the local economy despite misguided claims from Washington and profit-driven developers. The city is actively exploring legal steps to block any form of oil drilling in the nearby Everglades, a unique biological treasure that we must protect. We will keep fighting this just as we have for the past several years, and continue putting our vital natural resources and the safety of our people first.”

"Health care is personal to me. I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed. My wife and daughter had been killed in a car crash — and lying in that bed were my two surviving little boys. I couldn’t imagine what it would have been like if we didn’t have the health care we needed immediately.

Forty years later, one of those little boys, my son Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only months to live. Through the hardship, I saw firsthand how important it is to have quality, affordable coverage — it means peace of mind that your medical bills won’t drown you in debt and helps provide hope that things will get better.

This fight is personal to me — like it is for so many Americans. And I promise you that if I’m elected president, I will protect your family’s health care coverage as if it were my own.",health

"I think Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are entirely correct to advocate for universal healthcare (although I don't agree with their specific plans) and the other candidates advocating for a ""public option"" are not being ambitious enough on healthcare.  We need universal healthcare.  Our healthcare system is largely broken. Costs are very high, quality is uneven and many don't have coverage or they have inadequate coverage. The right goal is to have universal coverage. By universal coverage I mean that every citizen is provided federal healthcare coverage for free. Most developed nations have a system that does this. I have a plan to do that as does Bernie Sanders and 
Elizabeth Warren. To my mind healthcare is a human right and we can only control costs & improve quality if we get everyone covered.  Others who are running are proposing a ""public option.""  A public option is a government run insurance company. It will have premiums, co pays, deductibles etc. A public option is ""fine"" in the same way that any incremental improvement is ""fine"" but it doesn't solve the problem. Where I differ with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren is on the form of universal healthcare. They are proposing a single payer system, which very few countries have. My universal healthcare plan is a ""mixed model"" like most developed countries have, including Germany and France. Everyone gets covered for free but they can ""opt out"" & have other insurance options. The reason I like a ""mixed model"" is because I believe it is better policy. A mixed model is easier to finance (since you don't have to change the whole system), it gives people choices (which they like) and it has shown to produce higher quality healthcare. Bottom line, I'm closer to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on healthcare than I am to the others.","health, social programs"

"Paintings like this remind us of the glory of childhood, yet childhood is far from glorious for millions and millions of children in this country and around the world. Protecting our children should be a national priority, yet among other things the United States is number two in the world for hosting child pornography websites. In the last year alone, tech companies reported 45 million impressions of online sexual and violent abuse against children. Our federal authorities know about it, yet only half the $60 million appropriated to stop it has been allocated to the effort. Without the proper funding, efforts are limited and stymied. We must rise up and shout about this. Many times people say “I don’t even want to know about those things because there’s nothing I can do and it just makes me depressed.” But it’s actually the opposite. Power goes where attention goes. Know about such things in order to talk about them in order to change them. Children have no capacity to defend themselves from abuse; it’s our moral and civic responsibility to do for them what they cannot do for themselves. There should be a public outcry about it, a demand that the fight against online abuse of children be properly funded and vigorously pursued. I think women are key here; we should be leading the charge. Given our numbers, American women could and should be a moral force for good. We have tremendous power that we’re not yet using, and number one should be the health and safety of children here and elsewhere. We should be fierce on their behalf, from safety to health to education to freedom. That’s central to my campaign for the presidency.

What I liked about Bernie was that he said what he believed, no matter who was in the room. I admired his passion. I liked his convictions. I thought people who failed to take him seriously would prove to be sorely mistaken. And, as it turns out, I was right.

Senator Sanders endorsed our campaign today and I want to thank him not just for the endorsement, but for his leadership on making our country a more just, fairer place.

It’s voices like his that refuse to allow us to just accept what is — that refuse to accept we can’t change what’s wrong in our nation — and that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn’t our responsibility too. 

He doesn't get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough. He has put the interest of the nation — and the need to defeat Donald Trump — above all else. 

I’m excited to continue the work Bernie started in the months and years ahead. As he says: Not me, Us.

And to Bernie’s supporters I make the same commitment: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.
